\title{Get the unique column entries of a design matrix}
\usage{
get_unique_column_entries(X_design, method, number_of_bins = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{X_design}{A numeric design matrix. Each row corresponds to individual
data.}

\item{method}{A string indicating the estimation method and determining the
post-processing. One of "emhk" and "tcmars".}

\item{number_of_bins}{An integer vector of the numbers of bins for the
approximate methods. \code{NULL} if the approximate methods are not used.
Currently available for "tc", "mars", and "tcmars".}
}
\description{
Given a design matrix, this function returns the list whose ith element is
the sorted vector of the unique entries appearing in the ith column of the
matrix. For entirely monotonic regression, Hardyâ€”Krause variation denoising,
and their generalization ('emhk'), 0 is dropped if exists. For totally convex
regression, MARS via LASSO, and their generalization ('tcmars'), 0 is
additionally included and the maximal element is dropped.
}
\details{
If \code{number_of_bins} is not \code{NULL}, then instead of the exact values of
entries, the endpoints of the bins including them are exploited. Bins are
equally-spaced in each coordinate, and they are constructed according to
\code{number_of_bins}.
