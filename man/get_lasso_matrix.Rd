\arguments{
\item{X_eval}{A numeric evaluation matrix. Each row corresponds to an
individual evaluation point at which basis functions are computed.}

\item{X_design}{A numeric design matrix. Each row corresponds to an
individual data. Basis functions are constructed from this matrix.}

\item{s}{A numeric scalar indicating the maximum order of interaction between
covariates allowed in the estimation method.}

\item{method}{A string indicating the estimation method. One of "em", "hk",
"emhk", "tc", "mars", and "tcmars".}

\item{is_scaled}{A logical scalar for whether the design matrix is scaled so
that every entry is between 0 and 1. If \code{FALSE}, the min-max scaling is
applied to each column of the design matrix.}

\item{is_lattice}{A logical scalar for whether the design is lattice or not.
Only used for "em", "hk", and "emhk".}

\item{number_of_bins}{An integer or an integer vector of the numbers of bins
for the approximate method. Currently available for "tc", "mars", and
"tcmars".}

\item{increasing_covariates}{An integer vector of monotonically increasing
covariates. Possibly used for "em" and "emhk".}

\item{decreasing_covariates}{An integer vector of monotonically decreasing
covariates. Possibly used for "em" and "emhk".}

\item{concave_covariates}{An integer vector of concave covariates. Possibly
used for "tc" and "tcmars".}

\item{convex_covariates}{An integer vector of convex covariates. Possibly
used for "tc" and "tcmars".}

\item{variation_constrained_covariates}{An integer vector of covariates whose
variation is constrained. Used for "hk" and "mars" and also possibly used
for "emhk" and "tcmars".}

\item{extra_linear_covariates}{An integer vector or a string vector of extra
linear covariates added to the model. Possibly used for "tc", "mars", and
"tcmars".}

\item{is_included_basis}{A logical vector indicating whether or not each
basis function is included in the LASSO problem.}

\description{
Given an estimation method, this function constructs the matrix for the
corresponding LASSO problem. This function also returns the logical vectors
for whether each basis function is restricted to have a positive coefficient
or a negative coefficient and whether its variation is constrained or not in
the model. Recall that basis functions correspond to columns of the matrix
for the LASSO problem. For totally concave regression ("tc"), MARS via LASSO
("mars"), and their generalization ("tcmars"), the scale factors of basis
functions, which are needed for rescaling, are additionally returned.
