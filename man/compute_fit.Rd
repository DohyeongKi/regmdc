\title{Compute the fitted values of an estimation method at given points.}
\usage{
compute_fit(
  X_eval,
  X_design,
  s,
  method,
  is_scaled,
  is_lattice,
  number_of_bins,
  extra_linear_covariates,
  coefficients,
  is_nonzero_component,
  is_included_basis = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X_eval}{A numeric evaluation matrix. Each row corresponds to an
individual evaluation point at which the fitted value of the estimation
method is computed.}

\item{X_design}{A numeric design matrix. Each row corresponds to an
individual data.}

\item{s}{A numeric scalar indicating the maximum order of interaction between
covariates allowed in the estimation method.}

\item{method}{A string indicating the estimation method. One of "em", "hk",
"emhk", "tc", "mars", and "tcmars".}

\item{is_scaled}{A logical scalar for whether the design matrix is scaled or
not. If \code{FALSE}, the min-max scaling is applied to each column of the
design matrix.}

\item{is_lattice}{A logical scalar for whether the design is lattice or not.
Only used for "em", "hk", and "emhk".}

\item{number_of_bins}{An integer or an integer vector of the numbers of bins
for the approximate methods. An integer if the numbers of bins are the same
for all covariates. \code{NULL} if the approximate methods are not used.
Currently available for "tc", "mars", and "tcmars".}

\item{extra_linear_covariates}{An integer vector or a string vector of extra
linear covariates added to the model. Possibly used for "tc", "mars", and
"tcmars".}

\item{coefficients}{A numeric vector of the coefficients of basis functions
in the fitted model (in a scaled domain). A vector obtained by removing the
zero components from the solution to the LASSO problem.}

\item{is_nonzero_component}{A logical vector indicating whether or not each
component of the solution to the LASSO problem is nonzero.}

\item{is_included_basis}{A logical vector indicating whether or not each
basis function is included in the LASSO problem.}
}
\description{
Given the solution to the corresponding LASSO problem, this function computes
the fitted values of an estimation method.
