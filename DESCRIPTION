Description: A collection of functions for fitting nonparametric regression 
    models with mixed derivative constraints. Available estimation methods are 
    entirely monotonic regression, Hardy—Krause variation denoising, totally 
    convex regression, MARS via LASSO, and their generalizations. Entirely 
    monotonic regression and Hardy—Krause variation denoising are multivariate 
    generalizations of isotonic regression and total variation denoising,
    introduced in Fang et al. (2021). MARS via LASSO is a LASSO variant of the 
    usual MARS method introduced in Ki et al. (2021). It can be thought of not 
    only as a multivariate generalization of locally adaptive regression splines 
    but also as second-order Hardy—Krause variation denoising. Totally convex 
    regression is a multivariate extension of univariate convex regression based 
    on total convexity (see, e.g., Gal (2008)). A document for totally convex 
    regression is now in preparation.
